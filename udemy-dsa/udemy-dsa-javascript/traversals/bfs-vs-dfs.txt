//If you know a solution is not far from the root of the tree:
Initial response: BFS
Response provided by lesson: BFS
    - starts searching closest nodes first

//If the tree is very deep and solutions are rare: 
Initial response: BFS
Response provided by lesson: BFS
    - DFS will take a long time
    - 

//If the tree is very wide:
Initial response: BFS
Response provided by lesson: DFS
    - BFS will need too much memory

//If solutions are frequent but located deep in the tree:
Initial response: DFS
Response provided by lesson: DFS
    - Quick solution than BFS

//Determining whether a path exists between two nodes:
Initial response: DFS
Response provided by lesson: DFS
    - 

//Finding the shortest path:
Initial response: BFS
